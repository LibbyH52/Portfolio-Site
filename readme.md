The layout and style of the landing page was based on [this](https://simplfolio.netlify.app/) portfolio.

The CSS to change the colour of icon bar was answer number 5 from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42586729/bootstrap-4-change-hamburger-toggler-color)

I use the following site to find some fonts that go with [Lobster](http://typ.io/fonts/lobster)

My website colour scheme was found here [12. Strinking and simple](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/).

I received some design inspiration from [here](http://seanhalpin.io/)].
