#### Content
The layout and style of the landing page was based on [this](https://simplfolio.netlify.app/) portfolio.

The landing page was also built using the skills learned in Section 2 of the  [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass). 

The background image for the landing page is from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/photos/pen-notebook-notepad-diary-4337521/) and is by [rupixen](https://pixabay.com/users/rupixen-11154019/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=4337521)

The CSS to change the colour of icon bar was answer number 5 from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42586729/bootstrap-4-change-hamburger-toggler-color)

My website colour scheme was found here [12. Strinking and simple](https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/).

I received some design inspiration from [here](http://seanhalpin.io/)].
